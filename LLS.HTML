    <h2>POWER OF COMPOUNDING</h2>
    <P>Power of compounding shows its magic after certain time. If you want to enjoy or want to take benefit of power of compounding then you have to wait patiently . let me illustrate this  </P>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want to take a round of earth . and 1st day you travel just 100 meters and next day you travel  200m and every day you travel double from previous day , then as the circumference of earth is 40075 km , then it take you 20 days to take a round of earth/to cover the earth . BUT you know what, you just cover 77 km only in starting 10 days and you travel other 40065 km in next 10 days or we can say you travel whole world in next 10 days , the catch here is that compounding works in later days </li>
        <li>if i give you 1 crore at once OR i can give you 1 rupee in 1st day and 2 rupee in seccond day and i double this amount for 31 days . which option are you going to choose.. if you choose 1st option then just wait and first understand how much do get if you choose the 2nd option . 
           just go tu  lumsum calculator (compounding calculator)
        put investment amount 1 , expected return 100% , and tenure 31
    you are going to make the fortune of 214 crores last day and if i add 1st day to last day payment you are the person of 527 crores , but yo know what yo just get 10 lakh on 20 th day . but you make the big portion in just last 11  days  </li>
    <li>so basically compounding works everywhere (in your health , finance , relationships). when you go to gym may be for first few months you don't see any change in your body after ,after few months you see exponencial growth and people think it as overnight success. so basically just give time , good things takes time , and allow compounding to give you exponencial returns  </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>POWER OF DIVIDENDS , RENTS AND LONG TERM INVESTMENT </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you invested 15 lakh in TCS in 2008-9 , when the price of tcs is 150 ,and you bought 10,000 shares , then boom in 2022 ,TCS is trading at 3500 to 4000 , and it declared dividend of 73 rupees dividend per share in 2021 , so you earned a dividend of 7 lakh 30 thousand in 2021 , and your shares worth between 3.5 crores to 4 crore, and the main part is that you from 2008 to 2021 , tcs declared total dividend of 537.5 per share and hence if you just invest 15 lakh , you earn 53 lakh 75 thousand as dividend and shares worth 4 crores. this shows that you have to think for lond term</li>
        <li>RELIANCE INDUSTRIES chairman Mr. MUKESH AMBANI , JUST get 15 crores annaul salary from his company , but you know what he pay 9 crores electricity bill of his famous house ANTILIA , and we all know about his luxury life , then how can he be able to handle such a great life style if his salary is so low compare to his expensis , the catch here is that , HE OWN 51% SHARES OF reliance industries and reliance industries has total outstanding shares 676.60 crores and Mr. ambani own 345 crores shares of RIL, in 2021 RIL declared  a dividend of 7 rupees per share , so he earned 2415 crores as divided from his comapany , and that's why he is able to afford that lifestyle </li>
        <li>let's take one more example , my father bought a real estate property in 1997 in delhi , worth rupees 72000 only , and he spend 3 lakh in contruction so  total investment was 3 lakh 72 thousand  , today we are earning a rent of 30,000 monthly from that perticular property means we annually earn 3 lakh 60 thousand as rent and it's current value is 1 crore.. and like this hi owns many more properties. 
            Actually my father earn from jagran|shows and then hi invest that money in micro finacing as profit sharing model,then he earn profits from that investments, and put that money in cometies for 20 months , and he invest every month in comities , then after some time when he get lumsum amount he used to invest those amount in buying real estate or gold , and then when he got rents he put that money in FD and earn interest ,from that money , and then he spend that interst income on himself and on family, and now as he is  so engaged in real estates , he always get good deals and because of this , he started a real estate flip flop business and he earn commissions also, 
            lets sum up , all sources of income 
            <ol>
                <li>jagran|shows</li>
                <li>micro financing</li>
                <li>cometies</li>
                <li>real estate rents</li>
                <li>interest income from banks</li>
                <li>real estate flip flop commissions based</li>
                <li>in long run capital gain on all owned property</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>WE LEARN HERE IS THAT COMPOUNDING SHOWS IT'S POWER IN LONG RUN</li>

        <LI> <i><b>(DIVERSIFICATION)</b> </i></LI> <P><u> Different investment , same asset class </u>, for eg:- if you have 10,000  and you wish to invest this money in stocks then here stocks will be asset class , you decided to invest 5000 in large cap ,2500 in small cap and 2500 in mid cap , then this is called DIVERSIFICATION. If you are investing in different sectors eg:- metal, energy , fmcg , steel etc then also you are diversifying in stock market. </P>

    <P>Rule of 72 :- tell us how much time it will take to double our money , if our money grows with some rate of interest or return annually . eg:- if you get 12 percent annual return on your investment and now divide this percentage by 72 means 72/12 = 6 . IF YOU GET 12% ROI THEN IT WILL TAKE 6 YAERS TO DOUBLE YOUR MONEY. LETS TAKE FEW MORE example
